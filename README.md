# Real-Time Detection and Sorting of Commercial Marine Fish Species using YOLO11 Algorithm 

Undergraduate Thesis Project (Informatics Engineering, State University of Surabaya) - 2024/2025
- Developed a real-time fish species detection system to assist the sorting process of commercial marine fish using YOLO11 object detection algorithm.
- Contructed a custom dataset of 2,905 labeled images by combining four public datasets from Roboflow Universe and Mendeley Data.
- Applied data pre-processing (auto-orient, resizing) and augmentation (cropping, rotation, noise) to enhance model robustness using tools available on Roboflow.
- Trained and evaluated YOLO11n and YOLO11s models through six experimental scenarios with various data splits (70:20:10, 80:10:10, 60:20:20).
- Achieved the best performance using YOLO11n with 70% training data: mAP 95.1%, precision 93.2%, recall 91.0%, and F1-score 92%.
- Tools used: Python, Roboflow, Google Colab
